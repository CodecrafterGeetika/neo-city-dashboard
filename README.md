This is a lightweight web app that helps urban planners visualize climate and population challenges using free NASA Earth observation data. It overlays satellite imagery (NASA GIBS) and population datasets (SEDAC, WorldPop, GHSL) on an interactive map, and highlights hotspots where interventions like new parks, healthcare, or housing are needed.
